# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" using JavaScript. It allows two players to play against your computer and determines the winner based on the choices made.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser of your choice.

3. The game will be displayed on the webpage with three buttons for the player: "Rock," "Paper," and "Scissors."

4. Player should make selection by clicking on one of the buttons.

5. Once player have made his/her choice, the game will determine the winner and display the result on the screen.

6. To play again, simply click the "Reset" button, and the game will reset.

## How it Works

- The JavaScript code handles the game logic and user interactions.

- When a player clicks on one of the buttons, an event listener captures the click and retrieves the chosen option.

- Once both players have made their choices, the game determines the winner based on the following rules:

  - Rock beats scissors.
  - Scissors beats paper.
  - Paper beats rock.

- The result is displayed on the webpage, indicating which player won or if it's a tie.

## Customization

If you want to customize the game or extend its functionality, you can modify the JavaScript code in the `script.js` file.

Here are a few ideas for customization:

- Add more options to the game, such as "Lizard" and "Spock," following the rules of the extended version of the game.

- Improve the user interface by adding animations or visual effects.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Compatibility

The game should be compatible with all modern web browsers that support HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
